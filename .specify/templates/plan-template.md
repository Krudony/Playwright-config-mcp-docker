# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### React + Rust Clean Architecture Compliance

- [ ] **I. Clean Architecture Separation**: Frontend and backend are separate deployments with API-only communication
- [ ] **II. Rust Safety & Performance**: All Rust code uses ownership, Result<T, E> error handling, no unjustified unsafe blocks
- [ ] **III. React Component Cleanliness**: Single-responsibility components with TypeScript interfaces, custom hooks for shared logic
- [ ] **IV. Test-Driven Development**: TDD approach with minimum 80% code coverage, integration tests for APIs, component tests for React
- [ ] **V. API Contract Stability**: Versioned APIs with OpenAPI documentation, backward compatibility maintained

### Architecture Standards Verification

- [ ] Project structure follows frontend/backend separation
- [ ] Communication protocol defined (REST/GraphQL with JSON)
- [ ] Code quality tools configured (rustfmt, clippy, ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Database standards established (reversible migrations, connection pooling)

**Structure Decision**: Constitution requires React + Rust clean architecture separation as shown above. Frontend and backend must be independently deployable with API-only communication.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
